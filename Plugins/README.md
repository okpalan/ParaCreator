# ParaCreator Plugin System

## Overview

The **ParaCreator** plugin system allows users to extend the functionality of the module by adding custom scripts and configurations. This flexibility enables users to tailor their project structures and enhance their workflows according to specific needs. Plugins can be easily integrated into the existing **ParaCreator** framework, promoting a modular approach to project management.

## Creating a Plugin

### 1. **Define the Plugin Structure**

Each plugin should follow a predefined directory structure to ensure compatibility with the **ParaCreator** module. The suggested structure is as follows:

```
ParaCreator/
└── plugins/
    └── para-plugin/
        ├── para-plugin.psm1
        ├── para-plugin.Tests.ps1
        └── README.md
```

- **para-plugin.psm1**: This is the main script file for your plugin, containing the functions and logic you want to implement.
- **para-plugin.Tests.ps1**: This file should include unit tests for your plugin's functionality, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **README.md**: A documentation file explaining the purpose of the plugin, how to use it, and any other relevant information.

### 2. **Developing Plugin Functions**

In the `para-plugin.psm1` file, define the functions that will enhance the **ParaCreator** functionality. Ensure that your functions are well-documented and utilize consistent naming conventions to avoid conflicts with existing commands.

### 3. **Integrating the Plugin with ParaCreator**

To integrate the plugin with **ParaCreator**, you will need to import the plugin module in your main **ParaCreator** script. This can be done by adding the following line in your module:

```powershell
Import-Module "C:\path\to\ParaCreator\plugins\para-plugin\para-plugin.psm1"
```

### 4. **Using the Plugin**

Once the plugin is imported, its functions can be utilized just like any other command in **ParaCreator**. This allows users to seamlessly extend their project management capabilities without modifying the core module.

## Testing the Plugin

### 1. **Unit Testing with Pester**

To ensure the quality of your plugin, include unit tests in the `para-plugin.Tests.ps1` file. Follow similar testing conventions used in the core **ParaCreator** module. This will allow you to verify that your plugin functions as intended and does not introduce any regressions.

### 2. **Running Tests**

After implementing your tests, you can run them using the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-Pester -Path .\para-plugin.Tests.ps1
```

This will provide feedback on the success or failure of your tests, helping you refine your plugin before deployment.

## Conclusion

The **ParaCreator** plugin system provides a powerful way to extend and customize your project management workflows. By following the structured approach outlined above, you can create plugins that seamlessly integrate with **ParaCreator**, enhancing its capabilities and adapting it to your specific project needs.
