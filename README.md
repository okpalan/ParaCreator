# ParaCreator PowerShell Module

## Problem Statement

In modern development environments, maintaining a well-organized project structure is crucial for efficient collaboration and productivity. Developers often face challenges in creating consistent directory layouts, managing configuration files, and integrating various tools and plugins to streamline workflows. Manual setup can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and wasted time, particularly in projects involving multiple components and stakeholders.

**ParaCreator** addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive solution for creating a standardized project directory structure. It automates the setup process, ensuring that essential subdirectories are created while adhering to a consistent naming convention. However, as project complexity increases, there is a need for enhanced functionality that supports configuration management, tool integration, and plugin extensions.

## Enhancements and Features

### Enhanced Directory Structure

In addition to the existing directory structure, **ParaCreator** now supports the creation of:

- **Config**: A dedicated directory for storing configuration files, ensuring that project settings are well-organized and easily accessible.
- **Integrations**: A space for third-party tools and integrations, allowing developers to manage external dependencies efficiently.
- **Plugins**: A customizable area for adding scripts and modules that extend project functionality, promoting modular development practices.
### Overview

**ParaCreator** supports a plugin system that allows users to extend its functionality by creating custom plugins.

### Creating a Plugin

1. Create a new `.psm1` file in the `ParaPlugins` directory.
2. Define functions in your plugin file.
3. Use `Export-ModuleMember` to export your functions.

### Loading Plugins

Plugins are loaded automatically when you create a new project structure. You can call your plugin functions after loading.

### Configuration Management

- **Config File Creation**: The module can generate configuration files (e.g., `.json`, `.yaml`) within the `config` directory based on user-defined templates. This allows for quick setup of project-specific settings, such as environment variables or API keys.

### Integration and Plugin Scripts

- **Integration Scripts**: Predefined scripts for popular tools (e.g., linters, formatters) can be included in the `integrations` directory. Users can easily enable or disable these scripts as needed.
  
- **Plugin Support**: The module provides a framework for adding custom plugin scripts. Developers can create and register their plugins to extend the module's capabilities, supporting a wide range of use cases and third-party tools.

### User-Friendly Command-Line Interface

- The module includes a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through the project setup process. Prompts ensure that all necessary parameters are provided, and helpful error messages improve the overall user experience.

## Usage

To create a new project structure with the enhanced features, use the following command:

```powershell
New-ParaStructure -BaseDirectory "C:\MyProjects" -ProjectName "javascript-course" -CustomSubdirectories @("custom-area")
```

### Example Structure Created

Upon executing the script, the following directory structure will be created:

```
base_directory/
└── projects/
    └── okpalan-javascript-course/
        ├── bloopers/
        │   └── .gitkeep
        ├── code/
        │   └── .gitkeep
        ├── videos/
        │   └── .gitkeep
        ├── working-git-project/
        │   └── .gitkeep
        ├── config/
        │   └── settings.json
        ├── integrations/
        │   └── linter.ps1
        ├── plugins/
        │   └── custom-plugin.ps1
        └── areas/
            ├── area1/
            │   ├── channel-graphics/
            │   │   └── .gitkeep
            │   ├── social-media/
            │   │   └── .gitkeep
            │   └── content-planning/
            │       └── .gitkeep
```
